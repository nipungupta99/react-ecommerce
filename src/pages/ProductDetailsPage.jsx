              "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
              denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you
              a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings
              of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
              happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
              because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
              pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
              extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
              or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
              because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
              can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
              which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
              obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
              with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
              consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
              pleasure?"

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
            model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
            years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
            and the like).

            dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
            blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
            will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
            pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a
            free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
            prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
            to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
            will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
            annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
            matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
            secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
            worse pains."
